/**
 This is a base class for different kind of onboarding types.
 
 This class can be used as is, but can also be subclassed to
 create different kind of onboarding experiences.
 
 The default behavior is that ``shouldBePresented`` is `true`
 until a first presentation has been registered, after which
 it becomes `false`. Other onboarding types will however use
 different rules to provide a different experience.
 
 Using an onboarding is easy. Just create an instance of the
 onboarding, and call ``tryPresent(delay:action:)`` when you
 want it to be presented. It will inspect its internal rules
 and state to determine if it should be presented of not.
 
 Call ``reset()`` to reset the onboarding state, at any time.
