 This onboarding type takes a boolean conditional, that must
 return `true` for ``shouldBePresented`` to become true.

 An example could be an onboarding that should only be shown
 when a certain condition kicks in.
 
 Other than that, this onboarding behaves just like the base
 ``Onboarding`` and is only presented once.
