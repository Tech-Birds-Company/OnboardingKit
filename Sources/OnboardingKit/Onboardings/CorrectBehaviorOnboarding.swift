/**
 This onboarding type can help users behave as intended, for
 instance to show a guide when the user fails multiple times.
 
 An example could be a puzzle game, where pieces can animate
 to their position after being incorrectly placed many times.
 
 Just call ``tryPresent(delay:action:)`` when a user behaves
 incorrectly or not as intended. The onboarding will perform
 the presentation after the defined number of attempts. Just
 call ``registerCorrectBehavior()`` when the user behaves as
 intended, to reset the onboarding state.
 
 Unlike ``DelayedOnboarding``, which the onboarding inherits,
 this onboarding type resets itself each time it's presented.
