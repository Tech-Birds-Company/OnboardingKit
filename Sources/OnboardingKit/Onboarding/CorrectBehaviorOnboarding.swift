/**
 This onboarding type can help users behave as expected, for
 instance by presenting a hint about what you're expected to
 do after you fail to do so a certain number of times.
 
 An example could be a puzzle game, where pieces can animate
 to their position after being incorrectly placed many times.

 Unlike the base ``Onboarding``, this onboarding resets once
 it's presented, since users should get the onboarding again
 if they keep behaving in an incorrect way.

 Call ``registerIncorrectBehavior()`` when users behave in a
 way that you think is incorrect. ``shouldBePresented`` will
 become `true` when it has been called a couple of times, as
 defined by the ``requiredIncorrectAttempts`` property.

 Call ``registerCorrectBehavior()`` when users behave as you
 want them to. It cancels all registered incorrect behaviors
 and makes the onboarding start from the beginning.
