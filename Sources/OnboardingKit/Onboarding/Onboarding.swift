/**
 This is a base class for various onboarding experiences. It
 can be used as is or subclassed to create different kind of
 onboarding experiences.
 
 The basic onboarding behavior is that ``shouldBePresented``
 is `true` until the first presentation is registered, after
 which it becomes `false`. The onboarding must then be reset
 with ``reset()`` before you can present it again.

 You can call ``registerPresentation()`` to register when an
 onboarding has been presented, if you handle a presentation
 manually. This will persist this presentation state for the
 onboarding and make sure that it isn't presented again. You
 can also call ``tryPresent(presentAction:)`` to perform the
 provided action if the onboarding should be presented. This
 causes the presentation to be automatically registered.
