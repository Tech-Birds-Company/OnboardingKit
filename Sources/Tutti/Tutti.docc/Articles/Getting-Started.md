#  Getting Started

This article describes how to get started with Tutti.


## Onboarding

In Tutti, an ``Onboarding`` is at the core of the onboarding experience and determines whether or not a hint or tutorial should be presented.

Tutti comes with different types of onboardings, e.g. `Onboarding`, `DelayedOnboarding`, `ConditionalOnboarding` etc. that can help you create a suitable experience for e.g. a first app onboarding, general instructions, games etc.


## Hints

In Tutti, a ``Hint`` is a short onboarding message that is intended to be displayed briefly, e.g. in a toast, callout bubble etc.


## Tutorials

In Tutti, a ``Tutorial`` is a longer, page-based onboarding experience, e.g. a multi-page first-launch app onboarding.
