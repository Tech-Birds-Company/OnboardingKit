# Hints

In Tutti, a ``Hint`` is a short onboarding message that is intended to be displayed briefly, e.g. in a toast, callout bubble etc.


## Creating a hint

This is the most basic way to create a hint:

```swift
let hint = Hint(
    title: "Welcome!", 
    text: "This button is new!")
```

As you can see, ``Hint`` has very basic data. It can be subclassed to create more complex or specialized hints.


## Hint presenters

To present a hint, you can use a ``HintPresenter``.

Tutti doesn't come with any built-in presenters and encourages you to write presenters that are specific to your app.

You can create your own presenters by implementing the ``HintPresenter`` protocol. Have a look at the demo for examples.


## Connecting a hint to an onboarding

In Tutti, hints are data carriers while presenters are responsible for presenting hints. 

To determine the behavior of a hint, you need an onboarding of some kind. Tutti comes with various onboarding types.

If you're not using a ``HintPresenter`` (you don't have to), first create an onboarding and check whether or not it should be presented:

```swift
let onboarding = Onboarding(id: "welcome")
guard onboarding.shoulBePresented else { return }
```

If so, you can create a hint, present it in any way then register the presentation:

```swift
let hint = Hint(title: "Welcome!", text: "Welcome to this app.")
// Present the hint in some way
onboarding.registerPresentation()
```

If you use a ``HintPresenter``, you just have to use `tryPresent` to avoid having to do all these manual steps:

```swift
let onboarding = Onboarding(id: "welcome")
let presenter = MyPresenter()
presenter.tryPresent(onboarding)Â { 
   // Present the hint
}
```

`tryPresent` checks whether or not the onboarding should be presented. If so, the presentation block will be triggered and the presentation will be registered.
