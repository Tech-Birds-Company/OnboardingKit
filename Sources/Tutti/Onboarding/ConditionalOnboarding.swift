/**
 This onboarding takes a conditional block, that must return
 `true` for ``shouldBePresented`` to become true.

 An example could be an onboarding that should only be shown
 when a certain condition kicks in, for instance to tell the
 user to do something.

 Other than that, this onboarding type behaves just like the
 base ``Onboarding`` and is only presented once. If you only
 want the condition to apply, you don't need this onboarding
 and can just check the condition right away.
