/**
 This onboarding type can be used when the onboarding should
 be presented after a number of presentation attempts.

 Delayed onboardings can be convenient when you need to show
 multiple onboardings. You can then use the requires attemts
 as a way to schedule how the onboardings are presented. You
 can also use a delayed onboarding if you don't want to show
 it immediately.

 ``shouldBePresented`` becomes `true` only after it has been
 called a number of times, either by calling it directly, or
 by calling ``Onboarding/tryPresent(presentAction:)``.

 Other than that, this onboarding type behaves just like the
 base ``Onboarding`` and is only presented once.
