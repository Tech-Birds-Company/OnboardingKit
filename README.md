</p>

Tutti has different onboarding types. A standard onboarding is shown right away and only once, while other types can require multiple presentation attempts, a certain number of "incorrect" actions etc. You can also combine different onboarding types to create new ones and reset the display state of any onboarding if you want to display it again. 

Tutti also supports multiple users, so that each onboarding is unique to each user.
