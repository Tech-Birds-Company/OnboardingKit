## About OnboardingKit

OnboardingKit helps you create onboarding expericences like hints and tutorials in `Swift` and `SwiftUI`. 

The result can look like this, or completely different:

</p>

OnboardingKit has different onboarding types. A standard onboarding is shown right away and only once, while other types can require multiple presentation attempts, a certain number of "incorrect" actions, etc. You can also combine different onboarding types to create new ones and reset the state of any onboarding to display it again. 

OnboardingKit supports multiple users, so that each onboarding is unique to each user.

OnboardingKit supports `iOS 13`, `macOS 10.15`, `tvOS 13` and `watchOS 6`.



## Installation

OnboardingKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/OnboardingKit.git
```

If you prefer to no have external dependencies, you can also just copy the source code into your app.



## Getting started

The [online documentation][Documentation] has a [getting started guide][Getting-Started] guide to help you get started with OnboardingKit.

In OnboardingKit, an ``Onboarding`` is at the core of the onboarding experience and determines if a hint or tutorial should be presented. A `Hint` is a short onboarding message that is intended to be displayed briefly while a `Tutorial` is a page-based onboarding flow.

To create a standard onboarding and use it to present a hint or a tutorial, you can do this:

```swift
let onboarding = Onboarding(id: "welcome")
onboarding.tryPresentÂ { 
    let hint = Hint(title: "Welcome!", text: "Welcome to this app.")
    // Present the hint, for instance in a toast or a callout
}
```

For more information, please see the [online documentation][Documentation] and [getting started guide][Getting-Started].



## Documentation

The [online documentation][Documentation] contains more information, code examples, etc., and makes it easy to overview the various parts of the library. 



## Demo Application
